# Predicting-Gas-Returns
Forecasting Weekly Gas Prices &amp; Returns (Univariate Time-Series Analysis).


This projects aims to forecast gas returns at some future lead time l= 1,2,3..., 13 weeks ahead. Since this process involves calculating best forecasts, probability limits are provided, where necessary, as a measure of accuracy on either side of the forecast. While typical price forecasts assume the series is generated by a stochastic process, this project explores deterministic models as well. In all these models, the tentative three step process of statistical modelling is applied: Model identification, parameter estimation and model diagnostics. 

The above listed procedures are illustrated with numerical calculations performed in the R software
